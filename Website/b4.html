    <h2>Team Associated B4</h2>
    <p>The B4 platform is undefeated on a world level since its release in 2003, winning four I.F.M.A.R. World Championships (Billy Easton, 2003; Neil Cragg, 2005; Hayato Matsuzaki, 2007; Martin Achter, 2009). The B4 has also carried Ryan Cavalieri to four straight R.O.A.R National Championships in Modified Buggy. With an unprecedented pedigree of World, National, and European titles behind them, the B4 development team spent countless hours to refine the B4 to produce the B4.1 Factory Team kit. 
    <p>Team Associated's Area 51 designers optimized the B4.1 Factory Team kit for the latest generation of racers whose cars are lighter and more powerful than ever due to the advent of new LiPo battery and brushless motor technology. With its race-ready components, Factory Team parts, and optimized suspension setup for use with LiPo batteries, the B4.1 Factory Team buggy puts its World Champion pedigree to work for you, lap after lap!</p>
